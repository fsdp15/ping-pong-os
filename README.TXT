This is a project which aims to simulate an operating system (tasks scheduling, semaphores, priorities, preemption, tasks comunication, etc) on a Linux Terminal.

All the ideas and concepts (ppos.h, ppos_data.h, queue.h and main.c) of this project belongs to Prof. Carloz Maziero. You can find more about it here: http://wiki.inf.ufpr.br/maziero/. What I did was the implementation (queue.c, ppos_data.h and ppos_core.c).

You can customize or create your own main.c to test this project.
